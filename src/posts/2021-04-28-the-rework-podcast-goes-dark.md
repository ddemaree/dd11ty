Sorry, one more Basecamp link: Jason Fried and DHH (and other 37signals/Basecamp folks, allegedly) wrote a book called _[Rework](https://basecamp.com/books/rework)_ about "the better way to work and run your business," which has [a spinoff podcast](http://rework.fm) covering a mix of Basecamp behind-the-scenes and overall thought leadership, hosted by Wailin Wong and Shaun Hildner. It's basically a nice business podcast that folks from Basecamp occasionally take over to talk about how great they are.

Or, rather, Rework _did_ have a spinoff podcast. [Wong and Hildner posted a 90 second "quick update" saying they are taking a hiatus](https://share.transistor.fm/s/aea77cb6) in response to the company's changes. And it's a pretty intense clip: Hildner couldn't even finish the show's standard intro, and Wong admitted it would be weird to carry on as normal.

And one side note, from the "shoulda seen this coming" department: despite Wong and Hildner serving as regular, weekly hosts for this podcast, their names are nowhere to be found on the show website. But you can probably guess whose names _are_ prominently mentioned:

> Rework is a podcast by the makers of [Basecamp](https://www.basecamp.com/) about a better way to work and run your business. While the prevailing narrative around successful entrepreneurship tells you to scale fast and raise money, we think there’s a better way. We’ll take you behind the scenes at Basecamp with **co-founders [Jason Fried](https://twitter.com/jasonfried) and [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://twitter.com/dhh)** and bring you stories from business owners who have embraced bootstrapping, staying small, and growing slow.

There's also this line:

> REWORK is proudly hosted by [Transistor Podcasting Company](https://transistor.fm/)

They credit their _hosting platform_, but not their _hosts_.
