From David Chartier at Macworld:

> Chrome for Mac left beta at the rather unceremonious version number of 5.0.375.55. It boasts many of Chrome’s most popular cross-platform features too, including syncing of both bookmarks and browser preferences (like themes, homepage settings, preferred languages, and even page zoom settings), and a full-screen mode.

Recent dev builds have seemed a bit flaky, but Chrome is a wonderful browser and hopefully this means Google’s worked out enough bugs for it to be usable day to day, even for serious businessmen like myself.

Here’s [the official announcement](http://googlemac.blogspot.com/2010/05/google-chrome-for-mac-ready-beta-now.html).
