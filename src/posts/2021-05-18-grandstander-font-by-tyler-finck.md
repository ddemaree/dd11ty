And it is _super_ friendlyâ€”at thinner weights it's a zany Comic Sans alternative, at thicker weights it's more like a sign painting font. It seems perfect for your kid's next birthday or all your passive-aggressive office signage needs. It's open source (under the SIL Open Font License), has variable weight and slant axes, and [it's available on Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Grandstander). (Found via [Mark Boulton's type specimens newsletter](https://newsletter.typespecimens.xyz/archive/the-specimen-digest-045-kerchunk).)
