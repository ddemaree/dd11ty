Gee, that was fast. Guess not enough people were using Oink to oink oinks.

In [my talk about naming things in January](http://speakerdeck.com/u/ddemaree/p/naming-things) ([video](http://vimeo.com/35801293 "Video of David Demaree's Naming Things talk at Refresh Chicago")), I spent like half an hour trashing critiquing Oink's product naming (hence the "oink oink" joke). Though it's fun to think I was among the first to diagnose a startup's fatal flaw, what really killed Oink — which will ultimately kill Path, Stamped, Google+, and anyone else trying to run a social network in 2012 not named "Facebook" — is that [social isn't a product](http://log.demaree.me/post/19259151097/as-it-turned-out-sharing-was-not-broken-sharing). No one is asking for a new app that lets them rate their sandwich, because it turns out that for telling your real friends about an awesome sandwich, texting, email, and Facebook all work just fine.
