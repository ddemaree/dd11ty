What if a huge internet company developed a software platform for TVs, got some huge device makers involved to make and sell the hardware with a big, splashy holiday-time launch, but forgot to check with the content providers to make sure it was cool with them first?

Put another way: I know all of us would love to live in a world where one _didn't_ have to make a deal with Fox, et al., before releasing an awesome new product as much as Google would. But that's not the world we live in, and Google seems to not know that.
