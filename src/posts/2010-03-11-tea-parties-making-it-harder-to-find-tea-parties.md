The conservative Tea Party movement so dominates the Google rankings, it's becoming harder and harder to find information pertaining to actual tea, y'know, the stuff you drink. From the _Tribune_:

> "I certainly can see and have seen some confusion with regard to the name they've chosen for their movement," said Dan Robertson, owner of The Tea House in Naperville, a major tea distributor. "When I first heard about it, I thought, â€˜Oh, maybe I can sell them some tea.' Then I realized that probably wasn't going to happen."
