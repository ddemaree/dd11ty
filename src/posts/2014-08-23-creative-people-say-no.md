Technologist Kevin Ashton (via [M.G. Siegler](http://parislemon.com/post/95543243672/creative-people-say-no)) on the power of saying no to things, excerpted from his book _[How To Fly A Horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Fly_a_Horse)_:

> Time is the raw material of creation. Wipe away the magic and myth of creating and all that remains is work: the work of becoming expert through study and practice, the work of finding solutions to problems and problems with those solutions, the work of trial and error, the work of thinking and perfecting, the work of _creating_. Creating consumes. It is all day, every day. It knows neither weekends nor vacations. It is not when we feel like it. It is habit, compulsion, obsession, vocation. The common thread that links creators is how they spend their time. No matter what you read, no matter what they claim, nearly all creators spend nearly all their time on the work of creation. There are few overnight successes and many up-all-night successes.
> 
> Saying “no” has more creative power than ideas, insights and talent combined. No guards time, the thread from which we weave our creations. The math of time is simple: you have less than you think and need more than you know.
