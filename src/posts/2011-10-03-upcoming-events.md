I'm excited to announce the following upcoming events, at which I shall talk about nerdy things and answer your questions about said things:

### ChicagoRuby Downtown, Tuesday 10/4 at 6 pm

I'll be giving this month's featured talk at the downtown ChicagoRuby meetup, speaking about Typekit's migration from Merb to Rails 3.0 and some of the lessons and tricks we've learned in the process. ChicagoRuby meetings are held at Thoughtworks's office in the Aon Center, 200 E. Randolph St. Space is limited and is going fast, so if you're interested in coming [please RSVP soon](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/events/21988631/).

### AIGA Chicago: The New Web Typography, Thursday 10/6 at 6 pm

I'll be joining [Jackson Cavanaugh](http://twitter.com/okaytype), [Erik Vorhes](http://twitter.com/erikvorhes), and [Nick Sherman](http://twitter.com/NickSherman) for a discussion on the future of type on the web at IIT's McCormick Tribune Campus Center, hosted by the good folks at [Monotype](http://www.monotypeimaging.com/). Tickets are $5 for students, $10 for AIGA members, $20 for everyone else. [Register now](http://www.aigachicago.org/events/new-web-typography) to attend.
