Gizmodo profiles the Nokia 1100, the 7-year-old model used by more than 250,000,000 people in (mostly) developing nations. It's easy for us here in the first world to mock Nokia for being (so far) a non-participant in the smartphone platform war being waged by (primarily) Apple and Google. But while Apple makes phones exclusively for rich Westerners, Nokia's product portfolio includes models like this one that are hard to design but easy to build, and sold to a _lot_ of people.
