I know what you're thinking: "we were still training soldiers to use _bayonets_?"

Apparently so. And apparently, they've even been used _this decade_:

> A group of 20 British soldiers near Basra fought off an ambush by over 100 Mahdi fighters in Iraq, but eventually ran low on ammo. They then resorted to a fierce bayonet charge that killed 20 militiamen and compelled the rest to flee or surrender, with only three British soldiers injured.

As conflicted as I am about organizations that teach young men and women how to disembowel people with swords, I might be more conflicted about the Army making their training practices _more_ like a video game.
