It's worth remembering that we didn't end up with a crippled health care bill because Democrats _just_ felt like giving a gift to the insurance industry. It's also because Republicans told them they'd vote for the bill if it got turned into mush, so Democrats turned it to mush, and the Republicans voted against it anyway.
