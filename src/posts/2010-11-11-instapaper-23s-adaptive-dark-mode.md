Marco Arment's [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com/) iOS app has long been able to switch into a light-text-on-dark-background mode for easier nighttime reading. That's useful, but not so interesting. Other apps, such as Amazon's Kindle app for iOS, do the same thing.

_Except_ that in the just-released version 2.3, he added the ability for the app to switch into dark mode _automatically_ based on whether the sun has gone down. And his method for determining whether it's dark outside is pure genius.
