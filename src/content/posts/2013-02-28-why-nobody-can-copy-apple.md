From [Charlie Kindel](http://ceklog.kindel.com/2013/02/19/why-nobody-can-copy-apple/):

This is why Google will never be able to [beat Apple at Apple’s game](http://ceklog.kindel.com/2012/06/07/wanna-compete-with-apple-focus-on-experiences/): Google’s customer focus is split between the advertiser and consumer.

I'd go further and say Apple designs products for _people_, and don't acknowledge those distinctions or treat different kinds of markets or use cases as totally different when designing products.
