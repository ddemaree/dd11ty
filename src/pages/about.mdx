# About Me

Since October 2021, I’m a product manager (PM) at Stripe supporting their Design Systems team. Our team’s work is most visible in Stripe’s Dashboard UI, though we’re working to scale up to more products across the company. (I only just started, so obviously not much to say here yet, but watch this space.)

Prior to Stripe, I was a PM at Google from 2018–2021, mostly on Material Design and Google Fonts. While I was at Google I worked on parts of Material 3, the new UI style that debuted in Android 12, co-led the launch of Material’s dark theme at Google I/O 2019, and shipped Google Fonts Icons and Google Fonts Knowledge (not to mention an update to Google Fonts’ logo).

Before that, I worked on Adobe Typekit (now called Adobe Fonts) from 2011–2018, initially as an engineer and tech lead, later as a principal product manager. I joined while Typekit was still a tiny startup (employee #16), and when I left we’d grown to about 50 people spread across three continents. At Adobe I led the launches of visual font search, desktop multi-sync, Typekit Marketplace, a major responsive update to Typekit’s UI (about which I talked to Ethan Marcotte & Karen McGrane on their podcast), and lots more.

And before that, I worked on a local listings site owned by Gannett, and as an independent consultant working on projects for Apple, MTV/VH1, ABC Networks, and others.

Writing & Speaking
A few years ago I wrote a book about version control, Git for Humans, for A Book Apart. You can read a sample chapter about making Git commits, “The Art of the Commit”, on A List Apart.
