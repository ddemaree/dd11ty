# About Me

Since November 2022, I'm the **principal product manager for Designer Experience at [Webflow](https://webflow.com/)**. The Designer is Webflow's main design surface ‚Äî it's the thing you use to create web pages ‚Äî so my job is kind of to look out for any and all ways that we can make creating in Webflow faster, better, etc. I've been making web pages and applications for almost three decades and Webflow is one of the best pro development tools I've ever used; getting to help lead its development is one of the most exciting opportunities I've had, and I'm excited to share some of the cool shit we're working on. üòé

For about a year before that, I was a **product manager (PM) at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)** supporting their Design Systems team. This is where I'm supposed to summarize the cool stuff we worked on and the impact I had. Truthfully, I joined as part of the massive over-hiring that the whole tech industry indulged in during 2021-22. The manager who hired me said during the hiring process that he brought me in to create a Material Design-esque visual language for Stripe's dashboard, work that was deprioritized right before my start date. My team was pulled into the project that launched as [Stripe Apps](https://stripe.com/apps), a developer SDK and UI toolkit allowing third parties to extend Stripe's dashboard using a robust, easy-to-use set of UI components. Sounds cool, right? It's a long story, but Apps was a major source of pain and angst from the moment it started, eventually leading to many of the executives and other leaders who pushed it forward being fired or laid off. It became apparent early in 2022 that a shoe was going to drop. The smartest people started looking for exits as soon as February or March; others trickled out over the summer. I left at the end of October (having made it to my first stock vest), one week before the mass layoff. At Stripe I worked with some of the most talented, lovely individuals I've met in my career, as well as some of the most toxic, horrible motherf**kers I've ever met. Many of the first group were laid off; too many of the second group are still employed.

A side note: I'm blessed (or cursed, or blursed?) with an highly developed bullshit-o-meter, which is problematic for a product manager in company cultures that value performative hustle and fake confidence. Being able to feel, identify, and call out bullshit are among the most valuable skills in life, and can be among the hardest to learn, because the best way to get good at smelling bullshit is, sadly, having had to wade through lots of it.

This asset can be a liability in any situation that's are founded on a bullshit premise. Like, let's say that you're a PM at a company that has no idea how it makes money ‚Äî for instance, a trillon-dollar search/email/social video/phone software/AI/self-driving car/etc concern that has one hyper-profitable business unit (ads) and _literal hundreds_ of unprofitable ones. Most businesses are made up of several profit centers, whose success is measured in dollars, and a few cost centers whose success is more abstract. At Google, nearly every business is a cost center, and most would scarcely qualify as businesses. In theory, Google teams (especially PMs) are incentivized to find ways that the technology they're creating will positively contribute, if not to Google's bottom line, to humanity's overall success.

The load-bearing pillars of my product sense are:

* [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor), which is usually summarized as "the simplest explanation is usually the best one," but more accurately something like: all other things being equal, explanations or theories with fewer assumptions are better than ones with more. Put another way, the more leaps you have to make in order to believe something, the less likely it is that the belief will hold up. This is especially relevant to product cultures that insist on data-driven (or, in today's parlance, "customer-obsessed") decision-making. It is very easy to build product cases on what look like good metrics, but which are probably second- or third-order effects. The best indicators are ones that are tightly, positively correlated with something you did ‚Äî you shipped the thing, a number of people used it a certain amount, and then revenue or retention went up. Many indicators fail Occam's razor because, when you poke at their underlying assumptions, it turns out they may not indicate anything at all.

* [Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor), which states, "never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity." It's not nice to call people stupid, so I usually reframe this as: all other things being equal, other people's behavior is almost never about you, and almost always about them. Note that that doesn't let people off the hook ‚Äî in some ways, it's _worse_ if someone does something unpleasant because they didn't consider the impact on you. In product contexts (not to mention corporate politics), Hanlon's law is a good reminder that other people aren't in your head, don't see or feel what you do, and the first job is to bridge that gap. The difference between good and bad product work is almost always whether someone succeeds in doing that. (A lot of individuals and companies routinely fail at it.)

* Years ago, _Time_ profiled McDonalds' then-head chef Daniel Coudreaut (the original article is no longer online, but it's referenced by [this post from The Awl](https://www.theawl.com/2011/11/a-conspiracy-of-hogs-the-mcrib-as-arbitrage/)), who hung a sign in his test kitchen that read, "It's Not Real Until It's Real In The Restaurants." I don't have a catchy name for the philosophical razor embodied by that phrase (maybe "Grimace's law"?), but it's perhaps the most important one to product work: when developing products, it only matters what you _ship_. Everything that leads to shipping something useful and valuable is good; anything that distracts from that is potentially bad. Here's the catch: you may not know the difference up front. This razor is a reminder to keep the real world of your users in mind at all times, even if you need to indulge in speculative work so you have more, better options.

I was a¬†**PM at Google from 2018‚Äì2021**, mostly on¬†[Material Design](https://material.io/)¬†and¬†[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). While I was at Google I worked on parts of Material 3, the new UI style that debuted in Android 12, co-led the¬†[launch of Material‚Äôs dark theme](https://design.google/library/material-design-dark-theme/)¬†at Google I/O 2019, and shipped¬†[Google Fonts Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons/)¬†and¬†[Google Fonts Knowledge](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/)¬†(not to mention¬†[an update to Google Fonts‚Äô logo](https://www.creativebloq.com/news/new-google-fonts-logo)).

Before that, I worked on¬†**Adobe Typekit**¬†(now called Adobe Fonts) from 2011‚Äì2018, initially as an engineer and tech lead, later as a principal product manager. I joined while¬†[Typekit was still a tiny startup (employee #16)](https://web.archive.org/web/20110311105617/http://typekit.com/about), and when I left we‚Äôd grown to about 50 people spread across three continents. At Adobe I led the launches of¬†[visual font search](https://blog.typekit.com/2017/09/06/visual-search-early-access/),¬†[desktop multi-sync](https://blog.typekit.com/2017/06/08/sync-multiple-fonts-easily/),¬†[Typekit Marketplace](https://blog.typekit.com/2016/11/02/announcing-typekit-marketplace/),¬†[a major responsive update to Typekit‚Äôs UI](https://blog.typekit.com/2016/08/18/preview-a-new-look-for-fonts-on-typekit/)¬†(about which¬†[I talked to Ethan Marcotte & Karen McGrane on their podcast](https://responsivewebdesign.com/podcast/typekit/)), and lots more.

And before that, I worked on a local listings site owned by Gannett, and as an independent consultant working on projects for Apple, MTV/VH1, ABC Networks, and others.

Writing & Speaking
A few years ago I wrote a book about version control, Git for Humans, for A Book Apart. You can read a sample chapter about making Git commits, ‚ÄúThe Art of the Commit‚Äù, on A List Apart.
