# Dials

Let's get to it. There aren't as many dials in this world as there used to be, but once there were tens of millions. The rotary dial (or “calling dial” if you look at the [patents in the 1920s](http://www.google.com/patents?id=EIJoAAAAEBAJ&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=calling+dial&source=bl&ots=50bVB4WnrK&sig=QrbMW6gZ-V_gnQLGnE09NE3q-LU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Yx0zUKXLCvCJ0QGX4oHwBw&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=calling%20dial&f=false)) represented a big change in how a person approached the Bell System network. Prior to dials you picked up the phone and the suddenly broken circuit animated some light in an unseen switching station; soon would come an operator, a real woman (they tried men but they talked back and wanted too much advancement) and the operator would say: “Number please?” Or something along those lines. Get me Baltimore! you might say. Or: “Murray Hill 5-9975.”

“Right away, Ma'am.” Or Sir. Then the operator, who had to signal to ask permission to wipe her brow, would move some plugs around to make the connection. Now you were emperor over leagues of copper string.

Decades pass and here, finally, comes the calling dial: pick up, a live circuit is offered up; start dialing. Ringring.

## The Dial

So-called “people” on the Internet are [writing about](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2012/08/18/Blogodammerung) how [no one blogs any more](http://blog.jonudell.net/2012/08/10/where-have-all-the-bloggers-gone/). I am one of these no-ones, by which they mean those of us who used to write things on the Internet and post them to our own servers, but have now instead gone over to centralized services like Twitter and Tumblr and Facebook, where we spend our time—the diaspora of the alienated transformed by convenience into an aggregation of the aggrieved, or something like that. And they think it's a shame, and it is a shame. So I took the Blogging Challenge and tweeted:

> I'm going to blog every day for a month. I'll start tomorrow. #bloggingchallenge

And I did. I blogged every day for a month. And then I stopped. I stopped because I didn't want to. I stopped because I didn't have anything to say. I stopped because I didn't want to be a blogger.

Listen, I get it. You don’t always have time to watch the water-cooler TV show on the night the episode airs, and sometimes there’s `a whole work day` (or more than one!) in between you and when you can watch it. But there’s one neat little trick that will save you from getting spoiled before you’re ready.

Just log off. Just log off!

```javascript
var x = 1;

if (x === 1) {
  console.log('x is 1');
}
```
