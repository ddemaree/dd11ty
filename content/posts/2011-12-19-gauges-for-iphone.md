A really nice, simple iPhone interface for the really nice, simple website analytics service from GitHub (who acquired it a couple of weeks ago along with its developers, Ordered List). I tried using their web interface to look at my Gaug.es stats on my phone this past weekend, and it was an okay, not great, experience. This app is much better.
