News flash: Googlers and Gmail users have different ideas of how social software should behave! Says Todd Johnson, Google's product manager for Buzz:

> We've been testing Buzz internally at Google for a while. Of course, getting feedback from 20,000 Googlers isn't quite the same as letting Gmail users play with Buzz in the wild.

Not that user testing is _that_ reliable or critical, but it does seem like a good idea for (say) grafting a social networking product onto people's private email accounts.
