Nice write-up from Mark Dalrymple on a new, _very_ long overdue feature in Objective-C: literal syntax for creating numbers, arrays, and dictionaries. In current Objective-C, to create a `NSNumber` object you have to write (for example) `[NSNumber numberWithInt:7]`. Now, you'll be able to create the same object with the much shorter `@7`. The new syntax is already supported for building Mountain Lion apps; can't wait until it works on iOS. (via [Brent Simmons](http://inessential.com/2012/03/16/mark_on_objc_literals))
