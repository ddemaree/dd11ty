Never let it be said Apple's CEO doesn't use his own products: for the second time recently an Apple customer reports having gotten a one-word e-mail answer to a question from Jobs himself. The latest question: _will the iPhone OS get a unified email inbox like Mail on the Mac?_ To which Jobs replied: "Yep."

Of course, this is not news because Jobs let slip a detail about a future product (a unified inbox being one of the "hundreds" of new features Apple would likely promote in an upcoming iPhone OS update) or because one of the most guarded men in America is answering his own e-mail.

No, it's news because in the unified-inbox email reply, his signature reads: "Sent from my iPad."

_NEWS FLASH: STEVE JOBS HAS AN IPAD. PLEASE REPOST._
