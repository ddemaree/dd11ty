Turns out almost everything you need to know about the differences between these companies can be found out by just looking at how differently they show off their flagship products on the Web. [Apple's iMac site](http://www.apple.com/imac) is clean, focused, and packed with ad-formational detail. The other guys' sites are, well, less so.
