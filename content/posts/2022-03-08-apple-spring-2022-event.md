# Stu-Stu-Studio

Today at their "Peek Performance" event, Apple announced a new Mac desktop monitor, six long years after discontinuing their last one. Back in the late '90s and 2000s Apple made a succession Apple Studio Displays, first CRTs styled with translucent plastic, like the original iMac, later the industry's first mainstream flat-panel displays. Studio Displays were followed by Cinema Displays, 


That this counts as very exciting news may be a sign of how depressing the real world is right now, as well as how far off the mark Apple was by not shipping this product years ago.

Here's what I predicted yesterday afternoon (and [tweeted](https://twitter.com/ddemaree/status/1500970462062514177?s=20&t=XGmHo55vmxBnXmtsT2ndQA), for proof):

> * [iPhone SE 5G](https://9to5mac.com/2022/02/23/5g-iphone-se-3-everything-we-know/) and [iPad Air 5G](https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/07/exclusive-ipad-air-5-to-match-ipad-pro-performance-with-m1-chip-5g/) seem likely given the rumor mill smoke, but likely not the main announcement
> * I’d be surprised (but not shocked) to see an M2 processor launch unless they’re planning to treat it as just a speed bump over the M1 family; WWDC feels more right for a new processor generation but idk
> * [“Mac Studio”](https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/04/exclusive-mac-studio-is-coming-is-it-the-pro-mac-mini-or-mini-mac-pro/) and [“Mac Studio Display 7K”](https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/04/apple-studio-display-7k-exclusive/) (why not 8K) and “affordable-ish Apple display”—I mean, eventually there’s gotta be a desktop with M1 Pro/Max, and it’s hecka unclear what a Mac Pro powered by an SoC would look like. A pro-spec Mac that’s more like a Mac Mini with an M1 Max and lots of I/O, paired with a display of your choice, seems like a good idea
> * Apple isn’t going to ship a mini LED display at a price mere mortals can afford (the tech isn’t that cheap yet), and yet the rumor mill says they’re shipping a relatively affordable display (compared to the Pro XDR—which is $5K+). That would imply a 5K IPS-based display, maybe with a nice webcam and microphone for WFH?
> * If they do ship a modular “pro” desktop, I sure do hope they also start offering the Touch ID keyboards in black/space gray!!!

For once, all the rumor mill's predictions turned out accurate, minus the "7K" display and "M2" processors that I'm sure we'll see later this year.

I don't have much to say about the iPhone SE or iPad Air updates, or for that matter, much to add about the Mac Studio.

But the Studio Display? I have lots to say about displays. Buckle up.

Apple used to make and sell monitors — great ones, even groundbreaking ones. They made CRT displays for Apple IIs and Macs in the '80s and '90s, and in 2000 debuted the first desktop flat-panel display. In the 2000s Apple made a succession of excellent aluminum-clad Cinema Displays, culminating in the LED Cinema Display and Thunderbolt Display. 

The Thunderbolt Display combined a 1440p (QHD) 27" LED-backlit IPS panel with webcams, good speakers, and an array of ports, making it a perfect desktop docking station for Mac laptops.

And then they canceled it. Apple's laptops switched to Retina displays in 2013 and USB-C ports in 2016, and rather than make a new Apple-designed display to support these new standards, they partnered with LG to develop a new Mac display, the 5K UltraFine. The UltraFine supports all the nice system integration features people expect from Apple's monitors, but is LG-branded, and instead of a lovely aluminum enclosure, it's clad in chunky black plastic.

Here's the thing about that UltraFine display, and the newly announced 5K Apple Studio Display: they use more or less the same IPS display panel. That's not a knock against the Studio Display, but may be one against the state of monitors in 2022. The 5K panel LG uses in the UltraFine, which Apple had also used in their 27" iMacs, is still almost the only Retina-resolution desktop display panel on the market. Despite 5K being perhaps the ideal resolution for a 27" desktop display, there remains only *one* 5K monitor on the market.

All this implies to me that Apple could've shipped this new monitor (or something close to it) 6 years ago, but chose not to. Why? My best guess is that it's either or both of two reasons:

First, given that Mac laptops were (and are) the best in the business, and Apple's other mobile devices like the iPhone have changed how we interact with technology, they bet against people wanting to work at desks, in favor of people wanting to work from coffee shop tables, couches, etc.

Second, though Apple had been an early leader in displays, by the 2010s the rest of the industry had caught up, offering lower-cost monitors that were just as good or better than Apple's, leaving Apple in the awkward position of charging a _lot_ more than competitors just for industrial design and some ports.

The same thing had happened with Wi-Fi routers: Apple's AirPort Base Station was one of the first Wi-Fi devices to hit the market in 1999, but by the 2010s you could get a good router for much less money, or even for free. 

Despite their reputation for form over function, modern Apple actually almost never sells products that are _only_ prettier, nor do they sell products that are just as good but cheaper. Apple's typical strategy is to get people to pay just a little bit more for products that are concretely better than the competition in at least one respect. For instance, AirPods are still more expensive than most "true wireless" earbuds around but are easier to pair with Apple devices and have longer battery life.

I think the monitor they would have sold in 2016 would have been just like the LG UltraFine they ended up selling, only prettier and more expensive. I also think that could have been fine because the UltraFine was (and is) the only 5K desktop display available — that would have been plenty to differentiate it from Dell or HP's monitors.

Anyway, that's all in the past now, and eventually, Apple acknowledged their mistake. In 2017, Apple invited select members of the press to their campus not to announce a product, but to announce a shift in product direction. From [TechCrunch's coverage of the press event](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/04/apple-pushes-the-reset-button-on-the-mac-pro/):

> Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller is talking to a small group of reporters in a white stucco building near its headquarters in Cupertino. The purpose of the discussion, while somewhat unclear initially, reveals itself a few minutes in.
> 
> The news, if you want it straight: Apple is acknowledging that the Mac Pro they introduced in 2013 has run aground on the cleverness of its own design, and they’re re-thinking the entire machine. In addition, they’ll be releasing a new external display — something it had previously opted out of.

Just as Apple had apparently bet that laptop users would want very thin laptops with lots of dongles and no physical Escape keys, they'd also bet that pro desktop workflows (which for Apple primarily means audio, video, and graphics) would gravitate toward multiple GPUs, and they built the 2013 Mac Pro around that assumption. Instead, GPU makers engaged in an arms race to build more powerful (not to mention bigger, hotter, and more expensive) single GPUs possible, which the Mac Pro's design lacked the thermal leeway to support.

As for that display they teased, it finally came out in 2019. Here's [Stu Machwitz on the then-new Pro Display XDR](https://prolost.com/blog/edr):

> Apple caused quite a stir with the announcement of their Pro Display XDR, a High Dynamic Range display that occupies a convoluted space in the market. It seeks to be both a Very Nice Computer Display, and a reference HDR video monitor — but by most measures it’s far too expensive to be the former, and not quite up to the rarified specs of the latter. Confusingly, it also outperforms some HDR displays costing considerably more, by some metrics. It’s currently the only display-only device Apple makes, and it’s simultaneously ludicrously expensive and a too-good-to-be-true deal. Suffice it to say that while there may be very few people for whom the Pro Display XDR is the unquestionably right choice, they know who they are, and they don’t need the internet’s advice about it.

There are lots of wisecracks one can make about the Pro Display XDR and its pricing. For me, the ridiculous thing isn't the display itself — which, at $5,000, seems overpriced until you comparison-shop and find nothing anywhere close to its specs for less than $4,000 — but the add-on charges for the stand (which is very nice, but an extra $1,000), a VESA mount adapter (also nice, but $200), or to upgrade to a "nano-texture" glass finish (IYKYK, another $1,000).

As with the [$700 wheels for the Mac Pro](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX572ZM/A/apple-mac-pro-wheels-kit) or the $20 cleaning cloth, even when Apple's pricing isn't all _that_ absurd when you study it closely, there's just some cognitive dissonance when the company that sells the best $1,000 laptop in the industry charges the same amount for a monitor stand that only works with one monitor, which is the same price as five laptops.



## What I want(ed) to see from an Apple display

Apple stopped making and selling displays from 2015-2019, and even before that the last new display they had shipped was the Apple Thunderbolt Display that debuted in 2012. I got one of those displays shortly after it came out, and only got rid of it when it finally stopped powering on in early 2020. Designers at my last job would compete for the few Thunderbolt Displays still kicking around the office. Even now, it has a cult following.

Apart from aesthetics, what distinguished the Thunderbolt Display from other monitors was the bright, even backlight, hassle-free operation, and the built-in hub with a wide range of useful ports. Most pro monitors on the market today have built-in USB hubs (and the Pro Display has a USB-C hub), but the Thunderbolt Display also had an Ethernet port and a built-in MagSafe charger. It also had a webcam and decent speakers, allowing the monitor to serve as an all-in-one docking solution for MacBooks.

This, in a nutshell, is what I expect and hope for from a new Apple display: something that would make my Thunderbolt docking station and all my dongles unnecessary.
