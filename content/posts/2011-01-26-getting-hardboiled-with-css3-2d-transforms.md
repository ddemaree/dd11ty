Andy Clarke demonstrates one of the hottest CSS3 features: using `transform` to manipulate the size, placement and even _rotation_ of elements. (And, as if that weren't enough, tosses in some cool `:nth-of-type` pseudo selector action, eliminating the need for unnecessary `id` or `class` attributes in your markup.)
