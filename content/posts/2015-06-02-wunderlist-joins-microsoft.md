Microsoft continues buying up productivity-minded startups (see also [Accompli](http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/1/7298679/microsoft-acquires-acompli), [Sunrise](http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/11/7984603/microsoft-sunrise-acquisition-official)). This news comes hot on the heels of Wunderlist shipping their first API integrations; interestingly, fellow acquiree SunriseÂ was [one of their first integration partners](http://blog.sunrise.am/post/119356066789/sunrise-welcomes-wunderlist-on-android-ios-and). Makes one wonder [who else](http://slack.com) Microsoft might buy.
