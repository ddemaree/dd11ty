> I bought a Microsoft Surface yesterday. Long story, don’t ask why, it wasn’t for me. This is the story of the purchase. It started with a phone call to the Microsoft Pop-Up store at the Shops at Columbus Circle… Evan: “Hi, do you have any Surface tablets in stock” Sales Rep: “Yes, plenty!” …

One gets the distinct impression Microsoft never considered their stores as, y’know, _stores_, not just big, expensive, interactive ads. To wit: the Microsoft pop-up store at the North Bridge mall in Chicago has no signage that would tell people there’s an actual store where you can try, and buy, a Surface. Now, there are \*tons\* of Surface images and logos around the building, but they’re indistinguishable from regular Surface advertisements—there’s not even a caption or tag line saying “come visit the Microsoft Holiday Store at 540 North Michigan”.
