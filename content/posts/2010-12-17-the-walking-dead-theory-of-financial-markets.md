You know your favorite zombie-apocalypse cable TV drama has become a cultural touchstone when economics bloggers are using it to illustrate a point, as Mike Konczal does writing here about insurance regulation:

> Speaking at a conceptual level, I think it is fair to say that we regulate the #$@% out of people who hang the sign “insurance” on their door, and do not for those, like AIG did, that provide insurance without hanging the sign. As a result actual insurance agents who hang the sign are kind of how we idealize the boring bankers of times gone past.

> There’s good reason we regulate insurance – it needs to pay out exactly at the moment when it is the least likely to get paid. [I wrote a post for the Atlantic Business section](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2009/07/how-health-care-is-like-zombie-insurance/22368/) that asked how should you think of zombie insurance? How would you price a contract that paid $100 if the world turned into The Walking Dead, where cities were overrun with armies of zombies?

> The short answer is that you wouldn’t pay anything, since when you need to collect it the person on the other end is probably a zombie. This “who can credibly commit to backstopping bad events” goes towards a notion of the role the government can play in financial markets.
