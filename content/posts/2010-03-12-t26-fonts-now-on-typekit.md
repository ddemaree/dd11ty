If you visit [the T26 site](http://t26.com/) and peek in the right-hand corner of the footer, you'll see [a logo](http://practical.cc/) that might be familiar to you.

Note also that one of the fonts available today from T26 via Typekit is Aurea Ultra, a rockin' slab-serif from before slab-serifs got cool again.
