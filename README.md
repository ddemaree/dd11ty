# This is my personal site

It's always a work in progress, but especially right now.

This site uses [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), initially based on [Fotis Papadogeorgopoulos's template/demo repo](https://github.com/fpapado/eleventy-with-vite) but I've made lots of special modifications myself.

## To-do

- [ ] Trigger Vite page reload when Eleventy content changes (but, like, on purpose, not just because Vite is watching the entire tree)
- [ ] Repackage `dev-server.js` as a proper CLI based on `cac` and `chalk`
- [ ] Add a build command to the dev CLI
